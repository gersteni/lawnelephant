How you add a feature (or fix a bug) in Lawn Elephant
=====================================================

* If you are doing a really quick bug fix or very very small feature,
  then you can just check it into the master Lawn Elephant branch (if
  you have write access).

* If it's a bigger feature, I recommend writing the feature on a
  branch, and then, once it's done, merging it (carefully) into the
  master branch:

  % git branch my-new-feature-branch
  % git checkout my-new-feature-branch (switch to it)
  
  (now write your feature, using git diff, add, commit, etc.  When you
  are pushing changes to the server try "git push origin
  my-new-feature-branch")

* If you don't have write access to the master branch, now just email
  us and let us know we should evalutate your patch.  If you do have
  write access, you should go ahead and merge in your patch:
