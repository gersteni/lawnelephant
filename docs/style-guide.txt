Style guide for lawnelephant developers:
========================================

* You code should be a max of 90 characters wide (inclusive).  The
  exception is for strings that are really long--it's okay if these
  line break on a 90-char wide buffer.

* Indent correctly.

* Name new files with a .ss extension (not .scm).  Apparently this is
  a better, more cross-platform friendly way of doing things in PLT.
  (I know this hasn't been done universally in LeftParen, but we're
  trying to get there.)
